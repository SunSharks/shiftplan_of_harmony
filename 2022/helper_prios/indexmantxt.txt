Welcome. <br>
This program lets you rate each shift according your individual preferences. <br>
An optimization program will then search for the best possible shift distribution for everyone. If the number of shifts to be assigned does not divide the number of people without a remainder, there will be people who will be assigned more shifts than others. However, which persons get assigned how many shifts cannot be influenced by the individual preference specification.
Thus, an overall particularly poor evaluation of everyone will not result in fewer shifts being assigned, but only in the result being less satisfactory because no real trade-off has been made.
The best strategy for a result that is as satisfactory as possible for everyone is therefore simply to evaluate the shifts honestly.

<h2>Usage</h2>
In the input fields for each layer, put an integer from 1 to 5 representing the preference for that layer. <br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1</strong> means that you would love to take this shift.</li>
  <li><strong>5</strong> means that you definitely do not want to take this shift.</li>
</ul>
You can mark shifts with the conspicuously colored buttons in the upper part of each shift entry. If you enter a value in a marked layer, this value will be taken over for all marked layers.
All selections can be reset with "Unselect All".
